## The Problem:

As of early October 2021, NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information states that the United States has experienced 18 weather/climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each. 
Year-to-date, this is a record high. 
The average number of billion-dollar disasters per year is 7.

Certain occupational risks, such as injuries, noise, carcinogenic agents, airborne particles and ergonomic risks account for a substantial part of the burden of chronic diseases: 37% of all cases of back pain, 16% of hearing loss, 13% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 11% of asthma, 8% of injuries, 9% of lung cancer, 2% of leukaemia and 8% of depression.

Annually 12.2 million people, mostly in developing countries, die from noncommunicable diseases while still of active working age.

Work-related health problems result in an economic loss of 4â€“6% of GDP for most countries.

The basic health services to prevent occupational and work-related diseases cost on average between US$ 18 and US$ 60 (purchasing power parity) per worker.
About 70% of workers do not have any insurance to compensate them in case of occupational diseases and injuries.


Research has demonstrated that workplace health initiatives can help reduce sick leave absenteeism by 27% and health-care costs for companies by 26%.

## The Solution:

A  simple web application that;
1. Enhances safety and productivity of heros(field doctors and nurses, delivery drivers, news reporters, hardware engineers, security personnels e.t.c) by empowering them to submit text messages with evidences (images, videos) of hazards in record time to emergency response teams inorder to evaluate and mitigate disasters in record time.

2. Enables other heros such as frontline security software developers to recieve, visualize and evaluate notifications about bugs from various apps on the same dashboard in record time.
Software users can reports bugs via  text, screenshots, screencasts, silent and voiced screen recording of such bugs.

3. Preserve climate by helping preserve more trees that could be used to produce papers and cards for reporting hazards in developing or underdeveloped regions.

## Road Map
- Possiblity of frontline workers to report hazards to emergency response team via Computer vision,  Augmented Reality and Livestreaming Technologies.
- Safety verification, authentication and approval using Blockchain technologies.
- Relevant Safety policy and  safety compliance recommendations via Machine Learning, federated learning technologies and natural language processing.
- Possibilities for language translations.
- Map, Weather and Samsung API integrations.
- Possibilities for speech-to-text/text-to-speech  input/output.
- Possibilities for connecting our web app to non-smart phones via SMS, USD and toll phone call services.
