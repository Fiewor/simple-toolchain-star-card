The Problem:

As of early October 2021, NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information states that the United States has experienced 18 weather/climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each. 
Year-to-date, this is a record high. 
The average number of billion-dollar disasters per year is 7.
Certain occupational risks, such as injuries, noise, carcinogenic agents, airborne particles and ergonomic risks account for a substantial part of the burden of chronic diseases: 37% of all cases of back pain, 16% of hearing loss, 13% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 11% of asthma, 8% of injuries, 9% of lung cancer, 2% of leukaemia and 8% of depression.

Annually 12.2 million people, mostly in developing countries, die from noncommunicable diseases while still of active working age.

Work-related health problems result in an economic loss of 4â€“6% of GDP for most countries.

The basic health services to prevent occupational and work-related diseases cost on average between US$ 18 and US$ 60 (purchasing power parity) per worker.
About 70% of workers do not have any insurance to compensate them in case of occupational diseases and injuries.




Research has demonstrated that workplace health initiatives can help reduce sick leave absenteeism by 27% and health-care costs for companies by 26%.

The Solution:

A  simple web application that empowers frontline workers(field doctors and nurses, delivery drivers, news reporters, security personnels e.t.c), to submit evidences (images, videos) of hazards in record time to emergency response teams inorder to evaluate and mitigate disaster in record time.
