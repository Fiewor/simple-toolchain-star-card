## Overview:
Reporting workplace incidents  and hazard is not about calling out (or blaming) certain people or environments.

  It's about fostering  safety and productivity and as such, employees and supervisors are both part of the solution as day-to-day heros when it comes to mitigating risk.

This helps to gain a greater understanding of where risks are occurring and ensure  hazards does not grow into a more serious risk.

As of early October 2021, research shows that  the United States has experienced 18 weather disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each.

Annually 12.2 million people, mostly in developing countries, die from noncommunicable diseases while still of active working age.

Excessive Noise, Software bugs and ergonomic hazards could cause accidents, litigations and depression.

## What's the problem?
A few deterrent can discourage employees from reporting risk such; 
 1. Pressure to get the job done in a short amount of time.
2.  Lack of feedback from reported incidents.

## The Solution 
Research has demonstrated that workplace health initiatives can help reduce sick leave absenteeism by 27% and health-care costs for companies by 26%.

So, we created StarCard to be a central platform for real-time visibility into various hazards.

## Here is how it works:
The first person to witness a hazard
gets onto the web app, sign-ups,
fills a web form to make prioritized  reports of  hazards as text, picture and video format.
Then submits.
The data submitted is displayed on a dashboard for first responders to evaluate and prioritize  hazard reports.

## Road Map
- Possiblity of frontline workers to report hazards to emergency response team via Computer vision,  Augmented Reality and Livestreaming Technologies.
- Safety verification, authentication and approval using Blockchain technologies.
- Relevant Safety policy and  safety compliance recommendations via Machine Learning, federated learning technologies and natural language processing.
- Possibilities for language translations.
- Map, Weather and Samsung API integrations.
- Possibilities for speech-to-text/text-to-speech  input/output.
- Possibilities for using the web app to process hazard reports acquired from agents via sms, ussd and phone calls.
